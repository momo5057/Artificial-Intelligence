Answers to question:
Yes, I implemented the basic framework of a feed forward multilayer neural Network
Yes, I tested whether the feed forward and back propagation worked
I used all of the data sets
I have the set of layers as variables that are able to change and still work
I prepared the training examples for the XOR function but not the x^2 function

Instructions:
To run the program, just compile it
To change the training sets, change the array variables X and Y
X is the array with the pairs of inputs and Y is the array with the expected outputs
The results will be printed out, I have printed out all of the results to be graphed
